# React Native FlatList Performance Optimization

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's `FlatList` component when dealing with large datasets and complex item renderers, along with its solution.  The bug is characterized by slow scrolling, dropped frames, and an unresponsive UI.  The solution focuses on optimizing rendering to improve performance significantly.

## Bug
The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The key issue lies in inefficient rendering of list items, leading to performance degradation as the dataset grows.  The complex item renderer causes unnecessary re-renders.

## Solution
The `FlatListBugSolution.js` file presents a solution that incorporates several performance optimizations such as using `React.memo` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of list items, and `keyExtractor` to improve item identification.  Additionally, optimized rendering methods may be incorporated to further enhance performance.
